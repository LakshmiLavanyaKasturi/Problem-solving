Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.


Example:
p=[1,2,3,4,5) and q = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true

1. Define first binary tree as P and second as Q. 
2. Null check for both binary trees. If tree.p is null && tree.q is null. Return true. 
3. If p.left ==q.left. Push p.left value to the arrays of P and Q.
4. Check if p.right == q.right, if true, push p.right value to both the arrays.
5.
