Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1


Psuedo code:

1. Take input array into a variable. nums = [2,3,4,6,7]
2. Then, target = [5];
3. First check - Run a loop on all the numbers in the num and check if any of the numbers matches the target.
for(num=1;num<=num.length;num++)
{
    if(num[]==target)
    {
        return output = target;
        print value of the output
    }
    else
    start_index = num[0];
    end_index = num[max];
    search_num = (num[0] + num[max])/2;
    if(search_num < num[]) {
        end_index = search_num;
        
    }
    else 
    

    

    
}
